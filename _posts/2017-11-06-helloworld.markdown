## Pre-compiling CSS
I think pre-compiling CSS is a much easier and more structured way to code CSS. You dont have to repeat yourself like you do when you write CSS.
The technique I used was sass. You can write variables in sass, so you get a more structured code and if you want to make any changes in your CSS, you only have to change it in one place instead of everywhere. 
When you want to debugg your code it can be problematic, because the source code doesn't have the same line-number as the generated code.
