## Disqus
with disqus i opened a new file in _include and named it disqus.html where I implemented the code. And I include discus.html in post.html if comments are activated in posts.

### Disqus.html
```
    (function () {
        var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
        s.src = 'https://examination-1dv022.disqus.com/embed.js';
        s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
        (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
    })();
</script>
