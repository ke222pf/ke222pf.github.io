## Static site
I think that SSG are a great way to bulid a website. one noticeable thing about SSG is the speed, because a SSG only consists CSS and HTML files and doesnt need to rely on a database. though it can be hard to implement user interaction. A static site can hold much traffic because html pages take samll amount of data, and it provides good security. A easy thing about jekyll is that you can write content in a markdown language. which later can converte the text to correct html.
A static site is perfect if you want a text based site like a blog or organization sites
