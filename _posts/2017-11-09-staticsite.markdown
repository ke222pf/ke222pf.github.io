## Static site
I think that SSG are a great way to bulid a website. with a static site is that the visitors doesnt need to wait for the site to uppload, so it make the site faster. A static site can hold much traffic because html pages take samll amount of data, and it provides good security. A easy thing about jekyll is that you can write content in a markdown language. which later can converte the text to correct html.
A static site is perfect if you want a text based site like a blog.
