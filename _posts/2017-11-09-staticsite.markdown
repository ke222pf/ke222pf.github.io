## Static site
I think that SSG are a great way to bulid a website. One noticeable thing about SSG is the speed because a SSG only consists of CSS and HTML files and doesn't need to rely on a database. It can though be hard to implement user interaction. A static site can hold much traffic because html pages takes a small amount of data, and it provides good security. An easy thing about Jekyll is that you can write content in a markdown language, which later can converte the text to correct html.
A static site is perfect if you want a text based sites like a blog or organization sites.
