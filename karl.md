Hi, my name is Karl Erelöf. I'm a 24 year old guy born and raised in Lidingö which is a suburb in Stockholm, Sweden. My current location is Kalmar, Sweden where I recently moved to go to uni to pursue my goal to become a web-developer. When I'm not programming and doing all other kinds of computer stuff, I usually watch football and hang out with friends. Also during the summer season one of my greatest interests is waterskiing. That's a few facts about me. [click](/blogposts) Have a nice day!
